  Before start talking about Programming Languages let me clarify:

* I’m not arguing that any language is objectively better than any other.
* I agree that developers should eventually learn more than one language.

##  Top 5 programming language for beginners to learn in 2019

first you have to know about the **Ranking methods** , how programming language is being ranked in position ..
  it is quite simple, it will be rank according to three major topic

* **How Fast You learn**

To learn anything you need to know about how quickly you can learn the particular topics before starting it

* **Globel market Demand**

Lets, get targeted the demand on particular topic which you are learning is quite enough?? 
Ask Yourself a question Though you are learning the tpoic is simple and easily understandable but the Globel market demand is declining day by day than after completing you can't even get job on particular field thats Why market demand is important..

* **Productivity(Money)**

If you become well qualify for particular field , you primary demand is 
to earn money ,how to can convert your knowledge into income. You need to know about the income
which people are getting on particular field which you are qualify for..

Thats all three major topices determines the ranking of Programming language

Let’s dive right in with the first Programming Language:

**1. PYTHON**

Python is becoming one of the most popular programming language according to todays market flow, the **Syntax and the structure** is simple to understand thats why most of the developers moved towards **Python** now-a-days
 

* One of the popular programming language in the world

* Easy to learn and understand for absolute beginners
* Highest paid programming language in the world
* Real world Programming Language
* popular for AI , Machine learning ,Data science
* Python products are YOUTUBE,INSTAGRAM …

**2. JAVASCRIPT**

JavaScript is the most popular language according to **Stack OverFlow**. More than half of all developers use **JavaScript**. It’s vital to front-end development and increasingly relevant to back-end development.
 And it’s rapidly expanding into areas like game development and the (IOT) Internet of things.


 
* Popular Web programming language
* JavaScript is object based language as it provides predefined objects 
* Most of the JavaScript control statements syntax is same as syntax of control statements in  **C language** 

**3. SWIFT**

If you want to get into **IOS mobile development**, you should definitely consider **Swift** as a high-paid career path. Swift is a relatively new programming language released in 2014. It’s Apple’s new language options for programming
 native IOS and Mac-OS applications. Native apps have been found to outperform hybrid apps, and Sprite-Kit makes it even easier to build 2D games. 


* Popular for IOS application around the world

* Not easy for absolute beginner 
* Suitable for IOS developer to start with
* One of the C family product though name doesn’t matches 
* Mostly popular in IOS developed country i.e America, European country
* Applications are developed for iPhone , iPod and different IOS devices

**4. JAVA**

Java is arguably the most popular programming language you’ve ever heard. It is a language created by mighty James Gosling from Sun MicroSystems in 1991. There’s a great saying ”write once run everywhere” capture one of the keys that make Java so valuable. It’s powerful JVM (Java Virtual Machine) which makes it cross-platform compatible.


* Android Application can be made through it.

* Syntax is little bit complex than other programming language.
* Not for beginner to start with
* Most popular around South Asia 
* Android Based app like android app, games

**5. C++**

C++ is a highly efficient and flexible language, first created back in 1985. It has remained in high demand due to high performance, reliability, and variety of contexts you can use it in. Microsoft Windows and Google Chrome are the two of the most well-known projects created with C++, and indeed most of Amazon’s website are written in C++.


* One of the C family product

* Complex to start with
* Mostly use around the world though it is old programming language
* Developed to overcome drawback of **C programming**
* **Unity** was developed through it

A career with C++ involves developing desktop applications, especially performance-intensive tasks. You’ll find C++ in a wide range of applications– from GUI application to 3D graphics for a game to real-time mathematical solutions.

#### Conclusion

That concludes the list of top five programming languages you should consider learning in 2019. If you like what you read, share your knowledge with the community.
